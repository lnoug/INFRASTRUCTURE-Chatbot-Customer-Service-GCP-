# INTRO

A customer service chatbot can help customers get answers to their questions and solve problems quickly. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to create a functional customer service chatbot application on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). We will cover everything from creating a project to deploying and monitoring your chatbot application.


# SUMMARY

To create a chatbot that can talk to people and answer their questions, we need to use a special tool called Dialogflow. We will use Google Cloud Platform to create our chatbot. First, we create a new project on GCP. Then, we use Dialogflow to create our chatbot by telling it what kinds of things people might say and what kinds of things our chatbot should say back. We also need to teach our chatbot how to understand important information from what people say, like their name or what they're asking about. Finally, we test our chatbot to make sure it works well and can help people understand things better. To make sure our chatbot is working properly, we can use a tool called Stackdriver. It helps us keep an eye on our chatbot and make sure it's running smoothly.
